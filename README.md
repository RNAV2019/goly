# Goly - URL Shortener

Goly is a web application built with Svelte and Go that provides URL shortening functionality. It allows users to create, update, and delete URL redirects, which are referred to as "golies." The application uses Fiber as the web server and PostgreSQL as the database. Additionally, Goly implements WebSockets to provide real-time click counts for the shortened links.

## Features

- Create short URLs to redirect to long URLs.
- Update existing short URLs to redirect to different long URLs.
- Delete short URLs to remove the redirect.
- Real-time click count updates using WebSockets.
- Easy deployment with Docker for the database.

## Technologies Used

- Svelte: A modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Go: A statically typed, compiled programming language.
- Fiber: A fast, flexible, and easy-to-use web framework for Go.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database management system.
- WebSockets: A communication protocol that enables real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- Docker: A platform that allows you to automate the deployment and scaling of applications using containerization.
- Yarn: A fast, reliable, and secure package manager for JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

To run Goly locally, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Yarn: [Installation Guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- Go: [Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- PostgreSQL: [Installation Guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get Goly up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RNAV2019/goly.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd goly
   ```

3. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker run --name goly -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test postgres
   ```

4. Install the dependencies for Goly using Yarn:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   yarn install
   ```

5. Start the Svelte development server (hosted on http://localhost:5173):

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Change into the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```
7. Start the Go backend server:
   
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

The backend server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Configuration

Goly uses environment variables for configuration. By default, the application uses the following values:

### Frontend
- `PUBLIC_DB=http://localhost:3000/`
- `PUBLIC_WS=ws://localhost:3000/ws`

### Backend
- `DSN=postgres://user:password@domain:5432/database?sslmode=disable`

You can modify these values using the example in the `.env.example` file located in the corresponding directory.
